# A hostile campaign

<span style="float:left;font-size:40pt;line-height:1; font-weight:bold; margin-right: 9px">O</span>n August 3, 2011, David Drummond wrote a blog post claiming that Microsoft was waging "a hostile, organized campaign" against Google's Android operating system. At the time, Drummond was Google's[^1] Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. He was referring to the recent purchase of a large number of patents from Novell Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp. The goal of this purchase (which was made by consortiums led by Microsoft and Apple) was to control two large blocks of patents around mobile technology  (Drummond 2011). 

Purchased for $4.5 billion, the Nortel block consisted of some 6000 patents that, according to the LA Times, were considered "crucial to the future of mobile computing" (Olivarez-Giles 2012). Later that year, Google responded by buying Motorola Mobility for \$12.9 billion (Page 2013). Yet shortly after the deal, Google began selling off parts of the company. By 2014, all that remained of Google-owned Motorola were its patents. According to Google founder Larry Page, these patents would  "create a level playing field" and "protect the Android ecosystem" (Page 2013).

This patent war, I argue, provides evidence of antagonism between Google and Microsoft. The goal of this paper is to explore and interpret this competition using the framework of 'capital as power'. By doing so, I hope to add to a growing body of capital-as-power research looking at the accumulation strategies of specific firms and industries.


The paper is organized as follows:

* Section 1 reviews the capital-as-power framework developed by Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler. I discuss their concept of 'differential accumulation', and outline why the contrasting modes of 'breadth' and 'depth' are relevant to the analysis of Google and Microsoft. 

* Section 2 explores the idea that Google and Microsoft are competitors, despite the fact that they draw on different sources of revenue. 
I argue that both companies pursue differential accumulation through the strategy of 'breadth' (rather than 'depth'). 

* Section 3 analyzes the convergence of Google and Microsoft's differential profitability. After this convergence, I find that the two firms' differential profitability became negatively correlated. 

* Section 4 analyzes Google and Microsoft's internal and external 'breadth' strategies, which I find to be tightly correlated. 

* Section 5 concludes by discussing data limitations and by suggesting avenues for further inquiry.


# Capital as power and the logic of differential accumulation

Nitzan and Bichler's theory of 'capital as power' proposes that monetary earnings are a symbolic representation of the power struggle between different  groups (Nitzan and Bichler 2009, 218). Building on the work of economist and social critic Thorstein Veblen, Nitzan and Bichler divide society into two distinct yet interdependent spheres: 'industry' and 'business'.

For Veblen, 'industry' consisted of the set of collectively held  knowledge that underpinned society's productive capacity. To earn a profit, 'business' used private property to restrain industry --- an act of  strategic exclusion that Veblen called 'sabotage' (Veblen 1908, 534-536).
Following Veblen, Nitzan and Bichler argue that profit results not from the production of social goods, but from a firm's ability to "strategically limit social creativity and well-being" (Nitzan and Bichler 2009, 261). 

Having negated a connection with productivity, Nitzan and Bichler argue that profit should be interpreted 'differentially'. What concerns capitalists, they propose, is the size of  profit relative to other firms. This 'differential' profit, Nitzan and Bichler hypothesize, indicates firms' relative power. Capitalists' goal is therefore not to maximize profits, but to beat the average rate of return. To beat the average, firms seek ever-greater control over industry, as "others must be prevented from accessing the same earnings" (2009, 246-247). In short, Nitzan and Bichler see capitalism as a process of 'differential accumulation'.

Nitzan and Bichler argue that there are two distinct strategies for differential accumulation, strategies which they call 'breadth' and 'depth' (2009, 328). A 'breadth' strategy consists of expanding total profits faster than the average. Breadth can be achieve internally, through 'green-field investment'. Or it can be achieved externally through 'mergers and acquisitions'.  It is the latter strategy, Nitzan and Bichler propose, that is the more reliable route to differential accumulation. That is because green-field investment expands total production, effectively 'lifting all boats'. In contrast, mergers and acquisitions increase a firm's sales without expanding the total. Mergers and acquisitions are therefore the more reliable strategy for differential accumulation --- they increase a firm's *share* of profit (2009, 331). 

In contrast to 'breadth', which focuses on total profit, the strategy of 'depth' consists of raising a firm's profit *margin* faster than the average (or lowering it more slowly). While accumulation through depth is effective in the short term, Nitzan and Bichler argue that it is riskier in the long term. The problem is that because depth entails conflict, it is likely to meet stronger resistance (2009, 332). 
As a result, firms avoid depth strategies when possible and instead focus on breadth --- particularly mergers and acquisitions.


Capital-as-power researchers have applied the above schematic to the analysis of specific industries (Hager 2012; Nitzan and Bichler 2002, Ch. 5) and more recently to the analysis of specific firms such as Walmart (Baines 2015) and De Beers (Cochrane 2017). This paper applies the concept of differential accumulation to two powerful firms in the computer technology industry:  Microsoft and Google.

Although the two companies began with different sources of revenue, I argue that Google's expansion has brought it into direct competition with Microsoft. In 2017, Google's Android overtook Windows as the most used operating system (Lovejoy 2017). Google applications like Chrome, Docs, and Gmail provide similar services to Microsoft's Office suite. Google Search competes with Microsoft's Bing. Both companies are pursuing markets in data analytics, AI, and social media . Finally, Google and Microsoft are both rapidly expanding their cloud computing businesses (Jones 2021). In short, the two companies are competing for dominance in the tech industry.


# The rise of Google: a new business, an old model

Compared to Microsoft, which rose to power in the 1980s, Google is a relatively new player in the tech industry. Formed in 1998, Google became powerful in the 2000s and today has revenue that rivals Microsoft.

On the surface, Google's business model appears rather different from Microsoft's model. Microsoft derives income by selling its software as a 'product'. Google, however, gives its software away 'for free'. Google then derives income by selling advertising space embedded within the software. Thus, from the start, Google's income growth depended on ever-expanding revenues from advertising --- a 'breadth' strategy.

Figure 1 shows three ways of looking at this income growth. The top grey line plots the growth of Google's total revenue. The black line plots the growth of net income (profit). And the dashed line shows Google's markup --- the ratio of net income to total revenue. This evidence illustrates Google's pursuit of 'breadth'. Google increased its profit (net income) almost entirely by increasing total revenue. It's markup (an indicator of 'depth') remained relatively constant, oscillating around 20-25%. So it appears that revenue growth is Google's key strategy for increasing profits.

Although Google's business model differs from Microsoft's, it's accumulation strategy appears to be similar --- a fact illustrated by Figure 2. This figure shows the same analysis as in Figure 1, but now shows revenue, net income and markup for Microsoft. As with Google, Microsoft's profit growth depended mostly on increasing revenue. Also like Google, Microsoft's markup fluctuated, but showed no clear trend.

Having established Google's reliance on 'breadth', let us now look at its strategy for increasing revenues. From the beginning, Google derived most of its income from advertising, yet was trying to diversity its income stream. In 2008 and 2009, for instance, 97% of Google's total revenue came from advertising. Yet Google was already warning its investors that it expected revenue growth to slow: 

> We believe our revenue growth rate will generally decline as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition, the inevitable decline in growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels, and the increasing maturity of the online advertising market.
>
> <div style="text-align:right">(Alphabet 2009, 37)</div>

To bolster its income, Google looked to sources of profit outside the ad business. However, these new activities failed to alter Google's core revenue model. By 2019, Google still received 83% of its revenue from advertising (Alphabet 2019, 29). 

One of Google's new businesses was the 'Android' operating system. With Android OS, Google tried to replicate the 'ecosystem' model developed by Microsoft (Bradley 2017). Some commentators call this strategy a 'walled garden', but a better description would be 'monopoly'. By controlling the underlying operating system, Google controls the access point between software producers and  software users. 

The goal of operating-system monopoly, Michael Lewis observes, is to create a 'tollbooth' through which both consumers and producers must pay to access each other (2000, 71). For now, however, this tollbooth remains largely indirect. Google has refrained from selling software directly, and instead continues to earn income by selling ad space embedded in its software.


## Why breadth?

Why have Microsoft and Google increased profits almost exclusively by increasing sales? Why have they not tried to raise prices? There are several plausible reasons for this reliance on 'breadth'.

First, the software industry is a competitive place that is constantly expanding in new directions. Although the 'ecosystem' approach attempts to enclose and limit the free use of software, it is often unsuccessful. In general, software is a technology that remains relatively open and inexpensive to develop and transmit. 

The problem (for monopolists) is that any Stanford dropout with a computer can create the next 'game-changing' piece of software. It is therefore difficult for companies like Microsoft and Google to 'safely' raise prices. Doing so would make them vulnerable to cheaper competition. For dominant companies with massive fixed costs and a coterie of expectant stockholders, the safer bet is instead to buy new companies as fast as possible. By doing so, big firms gain new intellectual property, and with it, new revenue streams.

A second reason for the reluctance to raise prices may be the cost of incurring antitrust backlash. A major benefit of Google's 'free service' strategy is that it protects the company from antitrust prosecution. The reason is that since the 1970s, US antitrust law has been restricted to proving that monopoly harms 'consumers'. And consumer harm, in turn, is defined solely in terms of increasing prices (**source**). Although its revenue comes from advertisers, Google has successfully  portrayed software users as its 'consumers'. And since Google's software is free, it is difficult to show that these consumers are harmed by Google's monopoly.

This strategy reflects a broader trend in the tech industry, a trend prompted largely by the high-profile antitrust case against Microsoft at the turn of the millennium. The tech industry has shifted from a focus on 'production' to a focus on the control of 'access'

Adopted by companies like Amazon, Uber and GrubHub (among others), this strategy has a two-pronged approach. On the one hand, companies maintain cheap prices for end-use consumers, sometimes (as with Uber) to the point of direct subsidy. On the other hand, companies raise prices for *access* to their consumers. It is a model similar to the newspaper business of the 20th century. Software serves as platform for attracting users, and these users are then sold to the highest bidder.

This two-sided model, adopted wholeheartedly by Google and increasingly by Microsoft, is likely why both companies have pursued a breadth strategy over one of inflationary and disruptive depth.


# Convergence means conflict

When Google began operations in the late 1990s, Microsoft was a tech titan. But it would take only a decade for Google to catch up. 

Figure 3 plots Google's rise, measured in terms of 'differential profits'. In the early 2000s, Microsoft earned about 10 times more profit than the average firm on the S&P 500 --- a number that would remain relatively constant for the next two decades. Google, in contrast, entered the 21st century with about 100 times *less* profit than the average S&P 500 firm. But by 2010, Google had closed the gap.

As Google's profits became comparable to Microsoft's, the two companies became engaged in mutually antagonistic competition. Both firms attempted to gain breadth by "augmenting the relative size of \[their\] corporate organs" (Nitzan and Bichler 2009, 334). 

Interestingly, it was around this time that the profitability of the two companies changed 'regimes'. Prior to 2010, Google's profits correlated positively with Microsoft's. But afterwards, the correlation became negative.

Figure 4 shows this change in correlation. I plot here the growth rate of differential profitability for both Microsoft and Google. Prior to 2010, Google's profitability moved together with Microsoft (correlation +0.64). From 2011 to 2019, however, the correlation turn negative ($-0.39$). This divergence in profit growth rates occurred around the time that Google's profits caught up to Microsoft (Figure 3). After that point, neither firm was able to substantially increase its differential profits.

I contend that the two trends are causally connected. That is, Google's convergence to Microsoft levels of profit *caused* the divergence of profit growth rates that followed. The idea is that once Google became as large as Microsoft, the two firms competed for the same income stream. Thus after 2010, Google's  profit growth came at the expense of Microsoft's bottom line (and vice versa). Both companies are now 'big fish in a small pond', and are therefore encroaching on each other's core profit areas.

It is increasingly difficult for either Google or Microsoft to 'beat the average', for the simple reason that these firms are so large that they effectively *are* the average. Google is overwhelmingly dominant in the search engine market, controlling over 90% of the world's internet searches. As such, there is little room for Google to expand. Microsoft is similarly dominant in business and productivity software, leaving little room for growth. Because of this dominance, both firms have no choice but seek growth outside their core business. As they foray into mobile computing, cloud computing and everything in between, Google and Microsoft now compete directly with one another.[^plauteau]

Figure 5 reinforces this antagonistic relationship. I plot here the results of a two-step calculation. I first calculate the differential capitalization of both Google and Microsoft --- their market value relative to the average market value of S&P 500 firms. Then I plot the rate of change of this differential capitalization.


<img src="../figures/softwarsfigure5.png" width=450 />  
**Figure fig-5: Annual rate of change in differential capitalization --- Google vs. Microsoft.**

<hr/>

From 2005 to 2019, Google's capitalization showed an antagonistic relation with Microsoft: their capitalization growth rates moved in opposite directions (correlation $-0.46$). This finding suggests that mutual conflict between the two firms may be a significant factor in predicting their future performance.


# Trading punches




Figure 6 shows the ratios of Microsoft and Google's annual net income to revenue, or markup. As Figure 6 shows, the two markups have converged. Assuming there is a relation between the two, one explanation might be that competition from Google forced Microsoft to lower prices to remain competitive. 

However, this is not intuitively plausible, as the two firms' core products do not directly compete with one another. Another hypothesis is that the convergence may also be a result of a convergence of costs. In other words, if Microsoft increases its investments in green field growth and new acquisitions without increasing its prices proportionately, the increase in costs will result in falling markup.

<img src="../figures/softwarsfigure6.png" width=450 />

Figures 7 and 8 provide evidence of this convergence in costs by showing how Microsoft and Google are closely matching each other's expansion. Their green-field investments and acquisitions have both risen over time, and at similar rates. Figure 7 shows the net annual purchases of property and equipment for each firm. The correlation between these purchases is 0.96.


According to the capital as power framework, internal breadth is undertaken through green-field investment, while external breadth is undertaken through mergers and acquisitions (Nitzan and Bichler 2009, 334). 

Following this logic, the tight correlation between Google and Microsoft's green field investment and spending on acquisitions suggests that the two companies are engaged in a direct struggle of differential accumulation through internal and external breadth. 

Indeed, the convergence of Google's and Microsoft's profitability levels coincides with a convergence in the levels of internal and external expansion undertaken by each company. Specifically, green-field investment, measured by spending on new property and equipment, and spending on business acquisitions by both firms show a close correspondence. In addition, a convergence can also be seen in markup.

Figure 8 shows the absolute annual change in each firm's spending on business acquisitions. By conventional logic, a firm's purchase value represents the current value of discounted future earnings. Thus, by matching the value of another firm's acquisitions, it logically entails at least the expectation of corresponding profitability. However, practically speaking, businesses are often purchased at prices far above what they are valued at in terms of capitalization. Conversely, the acquisition itself often results in a much higher capitalization then can be plausibly derived from the company's valuation.

**Figure fig-8: Annual absolute change in acquisitions --- Google vs. Microsoft.**

<hr/>

From a capital as power perspective, however, this has a certain logic. In terms of differential power*,* acquisitions, particularly of other large firms, increase a firm's *share* of the profit without increasing the overall size of the market. Thus, the value of a company's purchase in differential power terms reflects not just the positive value of future profitability, but the negative value of removing that profitability from the market and from the hands of other owners. What Figure 8 shows is that this process is apparently being undertaken by Google and Microsoft in a remarkably synchronous way.

Figure 8 is particularly impressive because, while it is theoretically simple enough to find a certain number of firms whose total value was equivalent to the spending of another firm, practically it would be quite difficult, as neither has any control over the number and value of the pool of businesses available for purchase in any given year. 

Yet, despite this difficulty, and despite the often extreme fluctuations of company valuations in a historically volatile business, for the years 2004-2016 the correlation between the change in acquisition spending between the two firms is 0.90. The reason I have left off the years 2017-2019 is that if Microsoft's purchase of LinkedIn is included in the data, the correlation drops significantly. I will speak more about why this abrupt divergence may be discounted in the conclusion.

## A war for patents

Finally, if the above charts plot the *quantitative* expression of accumulation, the events of the Novell/Nortel/Motorola patent war can be seen as an example of its *qualitative* expression. By the admission of Google's own Chief Legal Officer, Microsoft was at the time perceived to be engaging in strategic sabotage, not over their own territory of profitability, but over control of what they perceived as an area of future differential earnings *for Google*. While neither firm's core profits are currently derived from mobile computing *per se*, their actions show that mobile computing is one area in which they are struggling for control (or at least struggling to keep the other firm from controlling). 

If this is the case, then it may not be a coincidence that the year the consortiums signed these two patent deals was the same year that the rate of Google and Microsoft's differential profitability began to diverge. In other words, both firms' actions illustrate how differential growth can be carried out *against* other firms, and specifically how acquisitions can be used as a form of sabotage (Nitzan and Bichler 2009, 231-233). 

In the case of the Nortel patents, Microsoft sought control over a set of intellectual property rights, potentially with the intention of excluding Google from using them by suing the producers of mobile technologies that run Google's Android system for patent infringement. The aim was not an absolute increase in Microsoft's own profitability, but a loss for Google. In differential power terms, this is perfectly logical, because Google's loss *is* Microsoft's gain.


# Conclusion

Because differential profitability is an expression of differential power, any expansion of Google's power comes at a cost to Microsoft. Thus, it is in Microsoft's interest to curtail that power through *strategic sabotage*. On the one hand, as the Novell/Nortel/Motorola case study shows, Google and Microsoft may both be simply seeking to expand into new areas, as they run up against the breadth envelopes of their particular profit-making businesses. In this respect, mobile computing may be just one of many sites of differential growth. On the other, such expansion is always implicitly and often explicitly made against the growth of others, as beating the average does not necessarily require higher profits: simply maintaining profits in a shrinking market can also increase differential growth (as the spikes in 2001 and 2008 in Figure 1 show, differential growth can be higher in crises than in boom times).

While some interesting patterns can be drawn from this comparison between Microsoft and Google, the data are limited. Other big players -- Apple, Facebook, Amazon -- play a role in the conflictual struggle for power over new technologies and thus this analysis would benefit from further comparisons like this one, as well as between groupings of different firms at different times. The benefits of such comparisons can be illustrated by a brief look at the anomaly of Microsoft's purchase of LinkedIn, which diverges from the pattern of acquisitions we saw with Google.

We can see in Figure 9 that by 2017, Facebook was also closing in on Microsoft's differential profitability (note the log scale). This chart reproduces the differential profit data from figure 3, with the addition of the differential profitability of Facebook. Figure 9 shows what seems to be an emerging pattern. As another large software company's differential profitability converges on Microsoft's, Microsoft begins to acquire competing firms in that business. The repetition of this occurrence suggests that it may be Microsoft who is matching Google's acquisitions and green field investment as a strategy of containment. If this were true, the plateau in Google's profitability may be a result of resistance by Microsoft rather than an unrelated structural envelope to the firm's growth. It is still unclear from the data whether Google's differential profitability flattened at the same level as Microsoft by coincidence, because of an interrelated factor, or because, for the time being, resistance from Microsoft *is* the structural barrier to Google's profitability. Further data gathering and analysis may provide more definitive answers.

The data also suffer from being US-centric, while the software industry has become much more global. One could widen the focus to draw in non-US computer technology companies like Tencent or Baidu, which competes with Google on search in China. Mapping the complexities of these highly inter-related and often subterranean struggles is beyond the scope of this paper. Therefore, as it stands, my arguments are of an exploratory nature. However, the close relationship between the accumulation strategies of Google and Microsoft stands out, not in spite of, but *because of* this complexity, which often appears as so much noise. In that sense, my arguments are meant as a step toward achieving greater clarity in the analysis of the differential power trajectories of these incredibly powerful corporations.

# Notes

[^1]: In 2015 Google reorganized its different businesses into new conglomerate, Alphabet. For simplicity, in this paper I use the name "Google" to refer to both Google and Alphabet.

[^plauteau]: It is also worth noting that Microsoft's differential profitability stalled as early as 2000, suggesting that its barrier to differential profitability was unrelated to the rise of Google. The likely explanation was Microsoft was a victim of its own success, it's near total monopoly leaving no room for expansion. Still, the question remains why both firms *same* ratio of differential profitability --- about 10 to 1.
