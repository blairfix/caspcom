subtitle: A Capital-as-Power Analysis of Google’s Differential Power Trajectory

author: Chris Moure

abstract: The capital as power framework, developed by Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler, argues that the aim of business is not ‘profit maximization’ but the differential accumulation of social power. Using this framework as a theoretical starting point, the paper empirically analyzes the differential accumulation strategies of large software firms Google and Microsoft. It presents qualitative and quantitative evidence that despite the fact that Google and Microsoft currently derive the majority of their profits from separate businesses, and so by conventional logic are not in direct competition with one another, the two firms are nonetheless engaged in antagonistic competition over control of the computing industry.
