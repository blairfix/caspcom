A <i>Globe &amp; Mail</i> <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/inside-the-market/barricks-environmental-foes-jump-on-wobbly-miner/article11543121/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> suggested: “The long term outlook for Barrick shares hinges on many factors: the gold price is obviously the biggest driver, but the company also faces vociferous opposition from environmentalists and many residents around its mine sites, which should be a long term worry for shareholders.” In the chart <a href="#H1">below</a>, Barrick (blue) is compared to SPDR Gold Shares (green), a trust that holds bullion and replicates the price fluctuations of gold.

Since a peak in Sep 8, 2011 - where the chart begins - the price of gold has dropped just over 20%. Barrick, however, is down 65% as of April 29, 2013, while the S&amp;P500 (red) is up more than <a href="#H2">35%</a>. Other Canadian-based <a href="#H3">mining companies</a> suffered 50% declines over this time period, and the fifteen percentage point differential could possibly be attributed to the <a href="http://protestbarrick.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">far greater activist attention paid to Barrick</a>.
