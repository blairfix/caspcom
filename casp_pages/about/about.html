<h1 id="capital-as-power">Capital as Power</h1>
<p>This site explores the idea of ‘capital as power’, a radical approach to political economy that conceives ‘capital’ as a symbolic quantification of power.</p>
<p>Our goal is to foster debate about received wisdom in political economy. As such, we conceive capital-as-power research as non-disciplinary. Contributions from any scientific background are welcome.</p>
<p>Our focus is both theoretical and empirical — a duality that we think is important. It corresponds with what we believe should be a guiding principle for radical research: in order to change the world, we must first understand it.</p>
