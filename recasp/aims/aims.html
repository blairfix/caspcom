<h1 id="aims-scope">Aims &amp; Scope</h1>
<p>The <em>Review of Capital as Power</em> (<em>RECASP</em>) is an interdisciplinary, peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of capital and capitalism. The journal invites contributions that engage with the idea that capital is <em>power</em> — a symbolic quantification of property rights. Both empirical and theoretical research are welcome.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-capital-as-power">What is ‘Capital as Power’?</h3>
<p>‘Capital as power’ is a framework for understanding and analyzing capitalism. First proposed by Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler, capital as power treats ‘capital’ not as a ‘thing’, but as a quantification of ownership rights.</p>

<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>A defining feature of capital-as-power research is a focus on ‘differential’ (rather than ‘real’) measures of monetary value. This can include (but is not limited to) differential capitalization, differential profit, differential income, and differential prices.</p>

<h3 id="past-research">Past Research</h3>
<p>The capital as power framework has been applied to a wide variety of topics, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the growth of dominant capital</p>
</li>
<li><p>capitalist income and business cycles</p>
</li>
<li><p>the growth of hierarchy</p>
</li>
<li><p>the nature of money</p>
</li>
<li><p>income inequality</p>
</li>
<li><p>debt</p>
</li>
<li><p>social movements</p>
</li>
<li><p>mergers and acquisitions</p>
</li>
<li><p>investment risk</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="criticism-welcome">Criticism Welcome</h3>
<p>The <em>Review of Capital as Power</em> welcomes research that is critical of the capital as power approach. This can include criticism of methods and/or of the capital-as-power framework itself.</p>

<h3 id="replication-and-null-results">Replication and Null Results</h3>
<p>We welcome research that attempts to replicate past studies, including those published in the <em>Review of Capital as Power</em>. We also welcome empirical work with null results (i.e. where the evidence does not support the tested hypothesis).</p>
