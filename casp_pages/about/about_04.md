# Capital as Power

This site explores the idea of 'capital as power', a radical approach to political economy that conceives 'capital' as a symbolic quantification of power.

Our goal is to foster debate about received wisdom in political economy. As such, we conceive capital-as-power research as non-disciplinary. Contributions from any scientific background are welcome.


Our focus is both theoretical and empirical --- a duality that we think is important. It corresponds with what we believe should be a guiding principle for radical research: in order to change the world, we must first understand it.
