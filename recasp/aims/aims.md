# Aims & Scope

The *Review of Capital as Power* (*RECASP*) is a non-disciplinary, peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of capital and capitalism. The journal invites contributions that engage with the idea of ‘capital *as* power’ – namely, the notion that capital is a symbolic quantification of organized power, and that capitalism as a whole can be studied as a mode of power. Both empirical and theoretical research are welcome.




### Past Research

The capital-as-power approach has been applied to a wide variety of topics, including:

* capitalist income and business cycles
* debt
* education
* income inequality
* inflation and stagflation
* investment risk
* mergers and acquisitions
* military conflicts
* social movements
* the growth of dominant capital
* the growth of hierarchy
* the nature of money and finance
* the origin of capitalism




### Criticism Welcome

The *Review of Capital as Power* welcomes research that is critical of the capital-as-power approach. This research can include criticism of specific studies, methods and the very notion of capital as power.

### Replication and Null Results

We welcome research that attempts to replicate past studies, including those published in the *Review of Capital as Power*. We also welcome empirical work with null results (i.e. where the evidence does not support the tested hypothesis).
