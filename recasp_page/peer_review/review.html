<p style="font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;">The <em>Review of Capital as Power</em> practices double-blind peer review. Neither the author nor the referees are known to one another.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;">Each manuscript is reviewed by two referees. If the reviewers disagree, we may consult a third referee. Reviewers should focus on constructive commentary that will help authors strengthen their article. We ask referees to complete their assessment within one month.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;">If you have a question about peer review, please <a href="mailto:blairfix@gmail.com">contact the editor</a>.</p>
