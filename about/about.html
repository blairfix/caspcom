<p>The Forum on Capital as Power brings together a diverse range of radically minded people who explore the idea of capital as power. We think this idea offers a promising new alternative for doing innovative research in political economy.</p>
<p>By conceiving capital as the symbolic quantification of power, the notion of capital as power challenges the conventional division between <em>politics</em> and <em>economics</em>, <em>real</em> and <em>nominal</em>, and <em>state</em> and <em>capital</em>. And by treating accumulation as a process of differential capitalization, capital as power offers new tools for empirically exploring capitalism.</p>
<p>The combined focus on both theoretical and empirical research is (we think) important. It corresponds with what we believe should be a guiding principle for radical research: in order to change the world, we must first <em>understand it</em>.</p>
