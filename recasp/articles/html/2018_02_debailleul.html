<h3>Corentin DeBailleul, Shimshon Bichler and Jonathan Nitzan</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top:1em;">Abstract</h4>

<p>In their paper ‘The CasP Project: Past, Present and Future’, Shimshon Bichler and Jonathan Nitzan invite readers to engage critically with their theoretical framework, known as capital as power (CasP). This call for further research, reactions and critiques is the perfect occasion to raise a few questions that have grown in my mind in reading Nitzan and Bichler’s work.</p>
