<h3>Purpose</h3>
The Critical Mass forum aims to bring together a diverse range of radically minded people who are dissatisfied with dominant approaches to political economy, and who seek to explore the possibilities and limitations of the concept of power as an alternative basis for re-thinking the tradition and its foundational categories of value, capital and accumulation.

Created and maintained voluntarily by graduate students of political economy at York University in Toronto, the ultimate goal of the forum is to extend beyond York in order to foster linkages between the broader global community of researchers engaging with these issues.

We aim to make this a space in which participants can express themselves freely and in a spirit of democratic scientific inquiry. To this end, participants are asked to refrain from any person attacks, abusive language and the posting of offensive material. Under no circumstances should the forum be used for commercial purposes (advertising or spam). Moderators reserve the right to expel members who are in violation of any of these rules.

<h3>Additional guidelines for each sub-forum</h3>

<h3>Political Economy</h3>
A topic can be about current affairs, but the original post should open up discussion. DO NOT post links without any explanation. Remember, many people on this board want to discuss political economy and how it can explain the world around us.
<h3>Events</h3>
Check to see if event is already posted. DO NOT spam the forum with the same event.
<h3>Research</h3>
It is ok to share parts of a project (e.g., one figure, one data problem, etc.). In fact, this sub-forum is designed for those that are trying to make advances on an on-going project.
<h3>Community</h3>
Try to foster a community of like-minded individuals. Talk about whatever, EXCEPT absolutely no posts or links with NSFW content. This forum is hosted by a university and it is assumed that members will keep conversations clean --- even when talking about movies, books, sports or whatever.
