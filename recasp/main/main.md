# Review of Capital as Power

The *Review of Capital as Power* (*RECASP*) is a non-disciplinary, peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of capital and capitalism. The journal invites contributions that engage with the idea of ‘capital *as* power’ – namely, the notion that capital is a symbolic quantification of organized power, and that capitalism as a whole can be studied as a mode of power. Both empirical and theoretical research are welcome.
