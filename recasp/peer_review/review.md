# Peer Review

The *Review of Capital as Power* practices double-blind peer review. Neither the author nor the referees are known to one another. 

Each manuscript is reviewed by two referees. If the reviewers disagree, we may consult a third referee. Reviewers should focus on constructive commentary that will help authors strengthen their article. We ask referees to complete their assessment within one month.

If you have a question about peer review, please [contact the editor](mailto:blairfix@gmail.com).
