Hey James,

I spent the weekend typesetting and editing your paper. I've attached my working version. 

This is such an important paper. In the interest of making your arguments crystal clear to political economy readers (who will likely be confused by your quant work) I've made edits that I hope will make things clearer. You are welcome, of course, to alter/reject any of the changes. Let's run through them.

**Abstract**. My philosophy for abstracts is that they should be short. (I also would like the abstract to fit on the title page.) I've taken the info you provided and edited an abstract that I think captures the essence of your arguments without giving too many details.

**Section titles** I've edited your section titles to be more descriptive. Please make sure they are appropriate.

**Figure captions** In the interest of clarity (for non experts), I've edited your figure captions to remove math symbols and to be more evocative.  My philosophy is to use Nitzan and Bichler's trick --- have figure captions that are provocative. Then provide the needed details in the notes.

**Figure notes** I've taken your in-text description of the figures and added notes. When it comes to complex quant work, redundancy is good. Many readers will simply scan the paper and look at the figures. You want each figure to be more-or-less self contained, so they don't have to go searching in the text to know  how to interpret the figure. Also, I think that the analysis is sufficiently complex that being (excruciatingly) explicit about what you are doing will help guide readers. Please check for errors in these notes.

**Index notation** I appreciate your index notation for the various data series. But I think that many readers will find it difficult to parse. For that reason, I've added text descriptions every time you reference one (i.e. system-fear index S_1, etc.)

**Lists** I've taken paragraphs where you listed points and turned them into numbered lists. I think this will help readers parse your arguments.

**Paragraph length** In general, I favor short paragraphs. Obviously this is an author's prerogative. But especially with dense empirical work like you present here you really want to spoon feed the reader. For that reason, I've split up many of your longer paragraphs.

**blockquotes** I've taken most of your longer quotes and converted them into blockquotes. I think this makes it easier to scan (which is how most people browse papers).

**background information** At certain points in the essay, I found non-expert readers could be reminded of background information that you referred to earlier.

I've attached my working version of the tex file. Please edit as you see fit and send it back. The abstract is attached in the metadata file.

It's been really interesting seeing your ideas come to fruition. I'm looking forward to applying them to our strategic sabotage project.

Cheers,
Blair
