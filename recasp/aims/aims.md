# Aims & Scope

The *Review of Capital as Power* (*RECASP*) is an interdisciplinary, peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of capital and capitalism. The journal invites contributions that engage with the idea that capital is *power* --- a symbolic quantification of property rights. Both empirical and theoretical research are welcome.

### What is 'Capital as Power'?

'Capital as power' is a framework for understanding and analyzing capitalism. First proposed by Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler, capital as power treats 'capital' not as a 'thing', but as a quantification of ownership rights. 

### Methods

A defining feature of capital-as-power research is a focus on 'differential' (rather than 'real') measures of monetary value. This can include (but is not limited to) differential capitalization, differential profit, differential income, and differential prices.


### Past Research

The capital as power framework has been applied to a wide variety of topics, including:

* the growth of dominant capital

* capitalist income and business cycles

* the growth of hierarchy

* the nature of money

* income inequality

* debt

* social movements

* mergers and acquisitions

* investment risk



### Criticism Welcome

The *Review of Capital as Power* welcomes research that is critical of the capital as power approach. This can include criticism of methods and/or of the capital-as-power framework itself.

### Replication and Null Results

We welcome research that attempts to replicate past studies, including those published in the *Review of Capital as Power*. We also welcome empirical work with null results (i.e. where the evidence does not support the tested hypothesis).
