It is exciting to see this website grow. Content is being added <a href="https://capitalaspower.apps01.yorku.ca/2013/08/the-capitalist-mode-of-power-critical-engagements-with-the-power-theory-of-value/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://capitalaspower.apps01.yorku.ca/">there</a>, and our <a href="https://capitalaspower.com/working-papers/">Working Paper Series</a> has its <a href="https://capitalaspower.apps01.yorku.ca/2013/10/no-20131-bichler-and-nitzan-can-capitalists-afford-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first paper</a>.

What already stands out on this website, in my opinion, is the strength of the empirical research. With our feet planted in society itself, we have before us a great big object in need of study: capitalism. Empirical research, as slow and tedious as it sometimes feels, gives a critique of capitalist power a foundation on which to construct broader, more general theoretical claims.

What is hidden from the presentation of empirical research, however, is all of time that was spent overcoming hurdles. The final version of a figure or table can look clean, but the person or persons responsible can tell you a long story about the difficulties involved.

Below is a simple visual representation.
