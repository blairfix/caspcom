Every research article in this journal undergoes a double blind review process whereby the author and two referees are not known to each other. Referees are asked to focus on constructive commentary that will help authors strengthen their article. Any question about the referee process may be addressed to the editor.

Where there is a radical divergence between the two referee reports, a third referee may be consulted.

Our aim is to review submitted articles in a timely fashion and publish them online immediately after the final review process and proofreading. Once we have five published articles, we will collate them as an electronic issue. In other words, papers will be published twice â€“ first as standalone articles and then as part of a journal issue. We ask our reviewers to take no longer than two months to write and submit their assessment.
